HSBC,Scenario ECL,"Given the full document content provided, extract the Reported ECL, Central scenario, Upside scenario , Downside scenario , Downside 2 scenario  ECL (Provisions)  for the following categories: Retail analysis and Wholesale analysis, as reported for the latest period presented in the document. Focus specifically on sections titled ""Wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis"" within the document, as these sections contain the detailed breakdown of Reported ECL, Central scenario, Upside scenario , Downside scenario , Downside 2 scenario by category. Use the following guidelines:

1. ECL refers to provisions on credit exposures for each category (Reported ECL, Central scenario, Upside scenario , Downside scenario , Downside 2 scenario), expressed in £m.
4. Locate and extract the data directly from sections titled ""Wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis"". If multiple periods are present, identify the latest period by the most recent date (e.g., ""As at [date]"") or context (e.g., ""current period"" vs. ""prior period""), and use only that period’s data. If subcategories are present, sum them for Balance and ECL, and recalculate Coverage if table percentages are inconsistent.
5. If OCR errors or inconsistencies are detected (e.g., Coverage percentages not matching ECL/Balance, unclear ECL values), prioritize calculated Coverage (ECL/Balance) over table-provided percentages, adjusting ECL or Balance where necessary to align with totals or logical consistency, and note adjustments.
6. ""Retail & Business Banking"" is split into Mortgages,EDB - Credit Cards, EDB - Other as separate rows within the table. validate totals against provided aggregates where possible.
7. If both on balance sheet and off balance sheet numbers are present, show only the on balance sheet numbers. 
8. Return the result as a JSON string with the following structure:

10. Include a note after the JSON detailing the data source (e.g., specific table), any adjustments made due to OCR errors or inconsistencies (e.g., recalculated Coverage, adjusted ECL), and validation against totals if applicable.

If the weightings are not found in the document, note that they are unavailable and refer to any previously provided data (e.g., a ""Scenario"" table with weightings for these scenarios).
Return the result as a JSON string with the following structure:

        ""Severe Downside"": {""Weight"": ""<value>""}
    }
}
Express the weights as percentage strings without the '%' symbol (e.g., ""10"" for 10%).
Include a note after the JSON detailing the data source (e.g., specific table or section) and any adjustments made if applicable. If the weightings are not found in the document, explicitly state this and reference any previously provided data (e.g., a ""Scenario"" table with weightings: Upside 10%, Base 55%, Downside 20%, Severe Downside 15%) that may align with the scenarios after adjusting for terminology differences.
If the required data is not found, state that the information is unavailable and explain why (e.g., missing table, lack of scenario weights)."

Shawbrook,Scenario ECL,"Given the full document content provided, extract the Upside  , Base , Downside, Severe Downside  scenario and reported Provisions  for the following categories:Real Estate, SME ,Consumer Finance and Retail Mortgage Brands  as reported for the latest period presented in the document. Focus specifically on sections titled ""ECL under 100% weighted scenarios "" within the document, as these sections contain the detailed breakdown of Upside scenario  , Base case scenario , Downside scenario , Severe Downside  scenario and reported Provisions. Use the following guidelines:

1. ECL refers to provisions on credit exposures for each category (Real Estate, SME ,Consumer Finance and Retail Mortgage Brands ), expressed in £m.
2. Locate and extract the data directly from sections titled ""ECL under 100% weighted scenarios "". If multiple periods are present, identify the latest period by the most recent date (e.g., ""As at [date]"") or context (e.g., ""current period"" vs. ""prior period""), and use only that period’s data. If subcategories are present, sum them for Balance and ECL, and recalculate Coverage if table percentages are inconsistent.
3. If OCR errors or inconsistencies are detected (e.g., Coverage percentages not matching ECL/Balance, unclear ECL values), prioritize calculated Coverage (ECL/Balance) over table-provided percentages, adjusting ECL or Balance where necessary to align with totals or logical consistency, and note adjustments.
4. Do compute the final number as per point 6 if ""Probability – weighted loss allowance per statement of financial position"" and ""Increase/(decrease) in loss allowance if scenario weighted at 100%"" by sum or difference based on increase and decrease.
5. If both on balance sheet and off balance sheet numbers are present, show only the on balance sheet numbers.
