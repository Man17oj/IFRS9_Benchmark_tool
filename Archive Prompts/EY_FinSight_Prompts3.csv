HSBC,Scenario ECL,"Given the full document content provided, extract the Reported ECL, Central scenario, Upside scenario , Downside scenario , Downside 2 scenario  ECL (Provisions)  for the following categories: Retail analysis and Wholesale analysis, as reported for the latest period presented in the document. Focus specifically on sections titled ""Wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis"" within the document, as these sections contain the detailed breakdown of Reported ECL, Central scenario, Upside scenario , Downside scenario , Downside 2 scenario by category. Use the following guidelines:

1. ECL refers to provisions on credit exposures for each category (Reported ECL, Central scenario, Upside scenario , Downside scenario , Downside 2 scenario), expressed in £m.
4. Locate and extract the data directly from sections titled ""Wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis"". If multiple periods are present, identify the latest period by the most recent date (e.g., ""As at [date]"") or context (e.g., ""current period"" vs. ""prior period""), and use only that period’s data. If subcategories are present, sum them for Balance and ECL, and recalculate Coverage if table percentages are inconsistent.
5. If OCR errors or inconsistencies are detected (e.g., Coverage percentages not matching ECL/Balance, unclear ECL values), prioritize calculated Coverage (ECL/Balance) over table-provided percentages, adjusting ECL or Balance where necessary to align with totals or logical consistency, and note adjustments.
6. ""Retail & Business Banking"" is split into Mortgages,EDB - Credit Cards, EDB - Other as separate rows within the table. validate totals against provided aggregates where possible.
7. If both on balance sheet and off balance sheet numbers are present, show only the on balance sheet numbers. 
8. Return the result as a JSON string with the following structure:

10. Include a note after the JSON detailing the data source (e.g., specific table), any adjustments made due to OCR errors or inconsistencies (e.g., recalculated Coverage, adjusted ECL), and validation against totals if applicable.

VMUK,IFRS9 Data by Stage,"Given the full document content provided, extract the Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 Expected Credit Loss (ECL), Balance (gross loans and advances), and Coverage (provision-to-loan ratio) for the following categories: Mortgages, Cards, Loans and Overdrafts, and Business, as reported for the latest period presented in the document. Focus specifically on tables labeled ""Gross loans and advances (1) ECL and coverage"" within the document, as these tables contain the detailed breakdown of ECL, Balance, and Coverage by stage and category. Use the following guidelines:

1. ECL refers to impairment provisions on credit exposures for each stage (1, 2, 3) and category (Mortgages, Cards, Loans and Overdrafts, Business), expressed in £m.
2. Balance refers to the gross loans and advances for each stage and category, expressed in £m.
3. Coverage is the ratio of ECL to Balance (expressed as a percentage) for each stage and category.
4. Locate and extract the data directly from tables titled ""Gross loans and advances (1) ECL and coverage."" If multiple periods are present, identify the latest period by the most recent date (e.g., ""As at [date]"") or context (e.g., ""current period"" vs. ""prior period""), and use only that period’s data. For Stage 2, use the total values (e.g., ""Stage 2 - total"" or sum of subcategories like 0 DPD, <30 DPD, >30 DPD) unless otherwise specified. If subcategories are present, sum them for Balance and ECL, and recalculate Coverage if table percentages are inconsistent.
5. If OCR errors or inconsistencies are detected (e.g., Coverage percentages not matching ECL/Balance, unclear ECL values), prioritize calculated Coverage (ECL/Balance) over table-provided percentages, adjusting ECL or Balance where necessary to align with totals or logical consistency, and note adjustments.
